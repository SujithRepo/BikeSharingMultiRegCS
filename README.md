This is a case study on building multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand of shared bikes. 
EDA analysis , Regression Model build has been performed on the obtained data set.


Approach:
The data set has been cleansed and evaluated for applicability of linear regression approach.
Data was split into Test and Training sets.
Multiple models have been developed to determine a best fit.
Model has been evaluated for Linear regression assumptions.
Overall Model fit has been verified.
On the Test set final predictions have been made using the best model. 
Actuals vs Predicted and R2 on the test data set has been performed.
